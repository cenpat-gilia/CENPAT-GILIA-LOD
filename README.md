# CENPAT-GILIA-LOD
CENPAT Linked Open Biodiversity Data

The objective of this project is made available some data sources from [Centro Nacional Patagónico](http://www.cenpat-conicet.gob.ar/), supported by the Argentinean National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET) as Linked Data. 
The data selected were generated by the researchers of the institution, and contains information of different biological species (mammals, plants, parasites, among others), mainly in the Argentine territory and made available as Darwin Core Archive files in the IPT server. These files are retrieved from the server, processed with OperRefine scripts, transformed to RDF according to Darwin Core Standar, published in a triple store and visualized.
This project is carried out in close collaboration with the group [GILIA](http://faiweb.uncoma.edu.ar/index.php/investigacion-y-postgrado/80-investigacion-y-postgrado/investigacion/389-grupo-gilia) (Grupo de Investigación en Lenguajes e Inteligencia Artificial) Departamento de Teoría de la Computación de la Universidad Nacional del Comahue.
